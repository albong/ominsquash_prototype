 - Switch to transparency for png's, over the magic pink
    - Add tileset layers (all drawn underneath of course), so that we can easily
      build stuff that takes advantage of transparency.
      For example, a house with transparency at the rounded corners means we
      don't need separate tilesheets for every kind of terrain the house might
      be drawn on.  Since the house is still just part of the background though,
      we should draw several layers to the room buffers.

 - Switch from arrays of pointers to arrays with pointer arithmetic.

 - Add options menu to pause menu, allow to change resolution, volume, and
   language.
    - As part of changing language, need to have central place where text files
      are loaded, then passed out.  The structs given out should be maintained
      by this central text logic, so that if we change the language, all the 
      underlying text can be reloaded without having to reload/update anything
      that loaded text - the structs are just updated underneath them.
      Probably call it text_creator.

 - Death screen (and debug mode to disable)

 - Abandon most homebrew editors relating to graphics.  Find a good map editor, and just come
   up with an import script.  We should probably still do animations (unless we can set
   timings in whatever program), and also hitboxes maybe.  Hitboxes could also just be a layer
   in whatever spritesheets so idk.
     - Investigate piskel and libresprite

 - Separate Entity into Entity and CollidableEntity (or something).  Entity has gotten really
   bloated, but it does remain the best way to have animations and such.  So we ought to have
   a base version with just graphics and positioning and action (which is set to the default
   that updates the animation), and a subclassed version with hitboxes and etc.

 - Rename all those atrocious shortended variables and types
