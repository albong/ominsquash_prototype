Download or clone source from git, this will be dev directory.

Download the development libraries for:
	- SDL2
	- SDL_image
	- SDL_ttf
	
Inside of these tarballs will be several directories.  "i686-w64-mingw32" is for
32 bit, and "x86_64-w64-mingw32" is for 64 bit.  In "bin" will be the .dll
files, please copy these to the root of the dev directory with the game files.
Copy these directories from each of the SDL extensions to the main SDL library
directory (the header and library files for the extensions like to be in the 
same directory as for the main SDL files).

Install a C compiler.

Modify the build.py script to appropriately reference the include/library 
directories for each library, and reference the correct C compiler.  You may
need to adjust the ENVIRONMENT_MODIFY variable to appropriately add environment
variables for the C compiler too.
