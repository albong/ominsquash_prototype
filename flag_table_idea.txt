Do we want to have a table of functions for flags also?  Like, when a flag is 
set/unset, we call this function?

I suspect that'd complicate things a bit with flags, but it might simplify the
logic necessary for other objects.  For example, suppose there are several
conditions needed to unlock a door; if for each related flag we have a function
check that the door's conditions are met, then we can just set the flag that the
door is open, without having to give the door any specified logic.

This could also be useful for playing cutscenes or triggering other behavior
as the player progresses.
