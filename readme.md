This is a game engine written in C.

It is not really intended for public viewing at the moment, but I don't want to pay for a private repo, and I haven't gotten around to moving to a different service.

The code is inconsistent in its style (although, as documents indicate, some effort has been directed to correct this), and is generally of low quality.
I made some decisions and got in some habits a long time ago that I knew were bad then, and I know are bad now.
The plan is to correct things as we go, with a large cleanup after a working demo has been completed.

For the companion editor (somehow even more garbage), see the omniedit repository.

There's a dev blog at omnisquash.wordpress.com, but since I'm in grad school it updates irregularly.
