Design Principles
-----------------

 -  Insofar as it is possible without herculean effort, the engine should be 
    pure C.  This doesn't mean that other languages can't be used for building
    or what have you, but the resulting code should be C.  This is to maximize
    portability, and to enable ease of coding for others.
    
 -  When possible, memory allocation/freeing should only be done in between
    areas, ie at loading screens.
 
 -  Minimize use of external libraries as much as possible.  Give preference to
    pure C libraries.
    
 -  Use size_t over int for indices.

 -  Don't compute anything during the drawing phase of the game loop.  Do all
    computation during the logic phase.
