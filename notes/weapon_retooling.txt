weapon.c/.h:
    CHECK - create and maintain a table of all weapons in the game
    
    CHECK - essentially, move the createTable function here, and then run all of the create methods in a row
    
    uhhhhhhhhhhhh... do we want to hide the "construct" and "destruct" bits in the entity?
    Better not, that isn't used yet and I don't know how it will be or what I intended
    
    CHECK - we should rework the create methods so that they receive allocated memory, rather
    than allocating themselves.  Is this a good principle for construct methods, ie
    they construct whatever the thing needs?
    
    
weapon_creator.c/.h:
    CHECK - remove
    
inventory.c/.h:
    CHECK - track what the player currently has in their inventory by holding arrays of
    booleans corresponding to id's
    
    CHECK - the weapon array should of fixed size from the beginning, as should the array
    corresponding to tradeable items I guess, but the array for keys should be
    resized on area changes I guess
    
weapon_table.c/.h:
    need destruct methods too
    
    rename "create" to "construct"?
    
collisions.c:
    CHECK - remove _player_weapons?
    
player.c:
    CHECK - 아이고
