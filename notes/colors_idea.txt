We should have everything be old school gameboy cream colored, with black outlines.
We could then just accent things with color, their shading and whatnot.

Its like the idea of making everything watercolored, but easier.

I also suggest to write a script to be able to blanket change a particular color across all images.
This seems like a good time to learn go, since python doesn't have the builtin for that but go does.
