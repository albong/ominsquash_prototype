If characters are 18x20, then with 14px offsets from the sides, top, and bottom,
and 6px space between each line, then we ought to be able to fit 19 characters 
on a line, with 3 lines.

This of course does not account for the scroll icon.  But if we're doing terminal
style font then it can just flicker over the last letter of the line.

The alphabet sheet has 10 rows of 10 characters each.  For now we'll just use
ASCII, but we need to come up with some way to encode and translate text later.
Also, we fully expect all text to be prepared so that it doesn't overrun the line.
Probably whatever script/utility we come up with for encoding later should take
all text, pad lines with spaces, and remove new lines, then we just read from 
the buffer no sweat.

Probs should've made the font width's odd numbers?
