Maybe put all text into one file, and give each lanuage its own master file?

I was pretty much against loading all of something at once, but this seems
like the most straightforward way.  We still have ids, but we just have them in
the file, like

01234
blah blah blah


We could give each kind of text its own file I suppose.  Like, menu.en,
interact.en, dialog.en, notification.en.  I kinda like that idea to separate
things.

Remember to thank Vince extensively later.
