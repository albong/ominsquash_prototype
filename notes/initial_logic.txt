Enities should have an initialLogic method.  This would be run at the end of
loading to do any setup, but NOT allocation.  This would be to separate any
setup conditions from the loading, and alter any self-state that has been set
by something else.  Namely the checking of the flag table.

For example - entities that are pickups for the player (like weapons), need to
check if they've already been picked up - if so, they should disable themselves.

This also may not be necessary, I dunno.  But it seems like it'd be good to
separate loading, setup, and logic.
