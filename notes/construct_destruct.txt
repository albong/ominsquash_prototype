We probably don't need Entities to have a "construct" method, since that will be
run whenever they're built from the table.

However, to ease the pain of freeing, they should have the destruct method, as
they may be far from the table at free time.

Alternatively, just have them hold their ID, and request those methods from the
tables at init/free
