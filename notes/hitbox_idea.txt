Hitbox types idea:

Flavor - display flavor text on button push

Interact - Push buttons, talk, etc

Movement - physically blocks the player/other movement hitboxes

Damaging - Can damage vulnerable areas

Vulnerable - Can be damaged by damaging hitboxes

-------

If we go this route, we should remove the CollisionTypes thing.  On the one
hand, this does make for more efficient code: we don't need to check weapon
hitboxes against interaction hitboxes, just movement and vulnerable, for 
example.  On the other hand, this feels like hard-coding; and I'm sure I'll come
up with more types later.  It also will probably lead to some code duplication?  

The alternative is to remove the interact/movement hitboxes altogether, just
have lists of hitboxes with different types.

Maybe a blended approach?  But that also seems dumb.
