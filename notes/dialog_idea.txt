Dialog should be a frame - it can manage the dialog tree and responses, then
pop textboxes onto the stack.  As long as it continually pushes textboxes onto
the stack, there shouldn't be any graphical interruption alerting the player to
the fact that there isn't a contiguous textbox, but actually several.
