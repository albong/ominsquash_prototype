We should have ids for doors.
Different rooms have the same ids, and various rooms have instances of the same
id.  Each door with the same id has static shared state about whether or not
its open; either from a c file for each door (maybe bleh, maybe not), or a list
of whether the given door id is open/closed unlocked/locked.

Maybe just some massive "master" door logic stuff somewhere?  idk
