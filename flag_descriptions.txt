    A test flag just to show how to format this file.  This file is descriptive
    and intended for humans, it will not be read by the game engine.  Its just
    that when you've got a jillion flags getting set all left and right, it's
    better to have some sort of document where you say what each flag is and
    does.  So please put descriptions of each flag and what flags each might be
    related to in here.  Try to say more than "door flag" cause there's gonna be
    a buttload of those.  Writing more here will make your life easier later.

    Another test flag.  Put some space in between these suckers.
