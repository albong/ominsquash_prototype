So here's my thought:

We mimic the way in which we currently change rooms.  However, we rename all of
the existing stuff to "shifting rooms" and all of the new stuff to "jumping rooms"
to avoid confusion.  That or we set changingRooms to 1 for shifting, and 2 for 
jumping.

Second, we need to check if the player is colliding with stairs DURING the logic
for the area.  That means we need to add a public method to collisions to do
this check.  Maybe pass in the list of stairs and the length, and have it
return the pointer/NULL for whatever was collided with?

Thirdly, we don't have area jumping yet, but that's next on the list.  I'm not
really sure how that'll fit, since that's a whole other layer of logic on top
of the animation to wipe the room.  Perhaps it would be better to abstract the
logic for halting input and animating room transitions, over the janky way it is
currently done?  I dunno.
